# PythonProjects
These are a few python projects that I made back when I was learning Python. Nothing substantial but some games that I made following along to a class that I took. There is a good chance that some of these were coded improperly and have bugs but they were the first projects that I built. I fixed a couple things while going through but didn't care to spend too much time as i've decided to go into web developement and no longer use python at this time.
